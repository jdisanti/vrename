vrename
=======

vrename is a simple tool that that takes file names as arguments,
formats them into a temp file with one file name per line, and then
opens that temp file with your preferred text editor (e.g., vim).
Once you're done editing the file names in your preferred editor,
it reads the file names back from the temp file and renames each
file to the new name from the file.
